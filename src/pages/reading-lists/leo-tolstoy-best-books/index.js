            <p><span className="big-letter">L</span>eo Tolstoy (1828 - 1910) was a Russian writer whose works have had a monumental impact on global literature. Like fellow 19th-century Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky (see our <Link to="/reading-lists/fyodor-dostoevsky-best-books/">reading list of Dostoevsky’s best books here</Link>), Tolstoy’s writings wrestle with deeply philosophical themes, offer incredible descriptions of (and insight into) the human condition, and have since their publication inspired philosophers as well as novelists.</p>

            <p>Often perceived to be among the pinnacles of realist literature, Tolstoy’s works are remarkable for the authenticity of the worlds, events, and lives they evoke. The 19th-century British poet and critic Matthew Arnold, for instance, commented:</p>

            <blockquote><p>A novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life.</p></blockquote>

            <p>The Russian writer Isaac Babel, meanwhile, noted:</p>

            <blockquote><p>If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.</p></blockquote>

            <p>Declared, too, by Virginia Woolf as “the greatest of all novelists”, Tolstoy enjoys such praise for very good reason. His characters are unforgettable; his exploration of the profound spiritual and philosophical journeys they embark on unrivaled.</p>

            <h2>1. War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy</h2>
            <BookLink title="War and Peace" author="Leo Tolstoy" link="http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Vintage-Classics-Tolstoy/dp/1400079985?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ac90599e9fc4d6b73e36db517a686d6a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.one.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />

            <p>Perhaps Tolstoy’s most famous work, and also his longest — <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Vintage-Classics-Tolstoy/dp/1400079985?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ac90599e9fc4d6b73e36db517a686d6a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">War and Peace</a> is utterly epic in scope, length, and reputation. The novel is regarded as one of the best ever written, but was actually described by Tolstoy as “not a novel” at all.</p>

            <p>For, published as a complete work in 1869, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Vintage-Classics-Tolstoy/dp/1400079985?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ac90599e9fc4d6b73e36db517a686d6a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">War and Peace</a> covers not just the complex development of its dozens of characters against the backdrop of the tumultuous Napoleonic era. No: Tolstoy also grandly philosophizes about the nature of history, love, fate, free will, power, meaning, and life itself.</p>

            <p>The result? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Vintage-Classics-Tolstoy/dp/1400079985?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ac90599e9fc4d6b73e36db517a686d6a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">War and Peace</a> is an exquisite read for literature and philosophy lovers alike.</p>

            <p>The translation of this particular edition is by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, which is the definitive, most celebrated edition of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Vintage-Classics-Tolstoy/dp/1400079985?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ac90599e9fc4d6b73e36db517a686d6a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">War and Peace</a> in English. If you’re interested in Tolstoy, literary classics, or philosophical novels, this book belongs on your bookshelf.</p>

            <h2>2. Anna Karenina, by Leo Tolstoy</h2>
            <BookLink title="Anna Karenina" author="Leo Tolstoy" link="http://www.amazon.com/Anna-Karenina-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0143035002?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=8d54b2d76752b3a65e30337aa6688e97&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.two.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />

            <p>“All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” So begins Tolstoy’s <i>other</i> famous epic, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Anna-Karenina-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0143035002?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=8d54b2d76752b3a65e30337aa6688e97&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Anna Karenina</a>, which was described by its author as his “first true novel”.</p>

            <p>Originally published as a complete work in 1878, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Anna-Karenina-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0143035002?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=8d54b2d76752b3a65e30337aa6688e97&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Anna Karenina</a> is (like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Vintage-Classics-Tolstoy/dp/1400079985?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ac90599e9fc4d6b73e36db517a686d6a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">War and Peace</a>) also regularly described as the greatest novel in history. Dostoevsky declared it “flawless”.</p>

            <p>And for good reason. With searing emotional intensity and philosophical profundity, Tolstoy develops a love story set in his contemporary Russia into a timeless, universal work of art that stands among the greatest achievements in literature. It is an undisputed masterpiece.</p>

            <p>The translation of this particular edition is also by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. As with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Vintage-Classics-Tolstoy/dp/1400079985?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ac90599e9fc4d6b73e36db517a686d6a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">War and Peace</a>, if you care about Tolstoy or literary fiction in general, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Anna-Karenina-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0143035002?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=8d54b2d76752b3a65e30337aa6688e97&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Anna Karenina</a> is simply an essential read.</p>


            <h2>3. The Death of Ivan Ilyich, by Leo Tolstoy</h2>
            <BookLink title="The Death of Ivan Ilyich" author="Leo Tolstoy" link="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Ilyich-Stories-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449612?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ced6a2710273bb69d8c2b1b8dc768db1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.three.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />

            <p>If you’re not ready to commit to one of his longer works, the best place to start with Tolstoy is his 1886 novella, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Ilyich-Stories-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449612?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ced6a2710273bb69d8c2b1b8dc768db1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a>.</p> 

            <p>Considered one of the pinnacles of Tolstoy’s late fiction, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Ilyich-Stories-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449612?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ced6a2710273bb69d8c2b1b8dc768db1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a> tells the story of a high court judge facing up to death from a terminal illness.</p>

            <p>What does it mean to live a meaningful life? In what ways do we deceive ourselves? What does our mortality mean for us? Tolstoy confronts such questions with beautiful, searingly insightful prose.</p>

            <p>This particular edition also contains some of Tolstoy’s other brilliant short stories, including The Raid, The Wood-felling, and Three Deaths.</p>


            <h2>4. The Cossacks, by Leo Tolstoy</h2>
            <BookLink title="The Cossacks" author="Leo Tolstoy" link="http://www.amazon.com/Cossacks-Everymans-Library-170/dp/0679431314?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=beb512faca8750a630f792fb4ab7c002&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.four.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />

            <p>Written before either of the novels he’s best known for (and first published in 1863), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Cossacks-Everymans-Library-170/dp/0679431314?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=beb512faca8750a630f792fb4ab7c002&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Cossacks</a> captures a young Tolstoy at his energetic best.</p>

            <p>The great Russian author draws on his experiences as a soldier in the Caucasus to produce a lean novella of love, adventure, and male rivalry. The economy of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Cossacks-Everymans-Library-170/dp/0679431314?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=beb512faca8750a630f792fb4ab7c002&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Cossacks</a>’s prose stands in stark contrast to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Vintage-Classics-Tolstoy/dp/1400079985?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ac90599e9fc4d6b73e36db517a686d6a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">War and Peace</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Anna-Karenina-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/0143035002?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=8d54b2d76752b3a65e30337aa6688e97&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Anna Karenina</a>, but thematically the novella foreshadows the profundity for which those later works are most celebrated.</p>

            <p>If you’re intrigued by the Tolstoy who existed <i>before</i> his epics, Ivan Turgenev described <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Cossacks-Everymans-Library-170/dp/0679431314?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=beb512faca8750a630f792fb4ab7c002&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Cossacks</a> as his favorite work by Tolstoy. Might it be yours?</p>

            <h2>5. The Kreutzer Sonata, by Leo Tolstoy</h2>
            <BookLink title="The Kreutzer Sonata" author="Leo Tolstoy" link="http://www.amazon.com/Kreutzer-Sonata-Stories-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449604?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=3cb66b24934ab4942c64faa0280a838c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.five.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />

            <p>Upon its publication in 1889, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kreutzer-Sonata-Stories-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449604?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=3cb66b24934ab4942c64faa0280a838c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Kreutzer Sonata</a> was promptly censored by Russian authorities. Tolstoy’s novella — inspired by his late, feverish embracement of Christianity — was deemed too scandalous and unusual for public consumption, detailing as it does a controversial tale of lust, jealousy, and murder.</p>

            <p>The censorship of the novella of course only increased its intrigue, with readers finding ways to consume Tolstoy’s thinly-veiled diatribe against sexual promiscuity.</p>

            <p>Though religious and spiritual transformations feature throughout Tolstoy’s work, nowhere is he as chaste as in this late collection of short stories, which along with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kreutzer-Sonata-Stories-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449604?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=3cb66b24934ab4942c64faa0280a838c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Kreutzer Sonata</a> includes Family Happiness, The Devil, and Father Sergius.</p>

            <p>If you’re intrigued by Tolstoy’s spiritual journey, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kreutzer-Sonata-Stories-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449604?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=3cb66b24934ab4942c64faa0280a838c&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Kreutzer Sonata</a> starkly — perhaps even disturbingly — illuminates his destination.</p>
