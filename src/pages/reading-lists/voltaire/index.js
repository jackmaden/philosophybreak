            <p><span className="big-letter">V</span>oltaire (1694 - 1778) is the pen name of François-Marie Arouet, a French Enlightenment writer, historian, and philosopher. Famous for writing with supreme wit and intelligence, Voltaire was a strong advocate of civil liberties, free speech, and the separation of church and state, and wrote sustained critiques on the philosophy and religion of his contemporaries.</p>

            <p>Voltaire was a true celebrity of his day — his satires and outspoken polemics brought him huge international recognition — and, along with <Link to="/reading-lists/john-locke/">John Locke</Link> and <Link to="/reading-lists/immanuel-kant/">Immanuel Kant</Link>, he’s gone down in history as a key voice for Enlightenment values. Writing thousands of works and pamphlets over his lifetime — from poems and plays to histories and novellas — Voltaire’s interests spanned virtually every literary genre.</p>

            <p>This reading list consists of the best books on and by Voltaire. After reading it, you’ll understand exactly why this brilliant French thinker was so popular in his own lifetime, and retains such influence in ours. Let’s dive in!</p>

            <p>If you’re seeking to dive a little deeper with your Voltaire scholarship, look no further than Roger Pearson’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Voltaire-Almighty-Life-Pursuit-Freedom/dp/0747579571?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=ef3a735034446928f8b7b3605d2bb3fb&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Voltaire Almighty</a>, first published in 2005.

            <h2>3. Candide, by Voltaire</h2>
            <BookLink title="Candide, or Optimism" author="Voltaire" link="http://www.amazon.com/Candide-Optimism-Classics-Francois-Voltaire/dp/0140455108?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=7264de9756fee7732f8e8878ea9f8c1f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.three.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />
            <p>Turning from introductions and biographies to primary texts, where better to start than with the novella that cemented Voltaire’s name into world history? Though not his most read work during his own lifetime, Voltaire’s 1759 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Candide-Optimism-Classics-Francois-Voltaire/dp/0140455108?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=7264de9756fee7732f8e8878ea9f8c1f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Candide</a> has become the text by which most people know the great French thinker today — and for good reason. Candide is one of the sharpest and most entertaining satires ever written, skewering a number of popular philosophical ideas of Voltaire’s time, including Leibniz’s suggestion that we live in ‘the best of all possible worlds’. Though Candide’s travels bring him to the heart of suffering and despair across the globe, he remains absurdly optimistic in the face of them. Voltaire thus brilliantly exposes “the mania for insisting that all is well when all is by no means well,” and his writing is as fresh and comedic today as it was almost three centuries ago — making <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Candide-Optimism-Classics-Francois-Voltaire/dp/0140455108?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=7264de9756fee7732f8e8878ea9f8c1f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Candide</a> simply essential reading for anyone interested in Voltaire.</p>
            

            <h2>4. Treatise on Toleration, by Voltaire</h2>
            <BookLink title="Treatise on Toleration" author="Voltaire" link="http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Toleration-Penguin-Classics-Voltaire/dp/0241236622?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=a393fe27154eee1c1c1be3d3e0af1a06&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.four.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />
            <p>In 1762, a merchant from Toulouse named Jean Calas was publicly executed after being accused of killing his son. The execution was particularly brutal — Calas was pulled apart by four horses, and it reportedly took a long time for him to die. However, after his death, it soon became clear that Calas was not guilty at all, and that he was persecuted simply for being Protestant in a Catholic-dominated town. Voltaire took great interest in what became known as <i>the Calas affair</i>, and began a campaign to clear Calas’s name. In so doing, he wrote dozens of pamphlets and texts that took the Calas affair international. Voltaire’s 1763 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Treatise-Toleration-Penguin-Classics-Voltaire/dp/0241236622?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=a393fe27154eee1c1c1be3d3e0af1a06&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Treatise on Toleration</a> is his story of this case — as well as a powerful polemic against fanaticism, a strong defense of religious freedom, and a rallying cry for tolerance. This important work encapsulates all that is brilliant about Voltaire: his bravery in standing up to established authorities, his attunement to Enlightenment values, and his brilliantly sharp, politically-engaged, persuasive writing.</p>
            

            <h2>5. A Pocket Philosophical Dictionary, by Voltaire</h2>
            <BookLink title="A Pocket Philosophical Dictionary" author="Voltaire" link="http://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Philosophical-Dictionary-Oxford-Classics/dp/0199553637?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=a96d6b49ffca3bf88a1ba76f7de24a1f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.five.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />
            <p>Voltaire’s controversial 1764 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Philosophical-Dictionary-Oxford-Classics/dp/0199553637?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=a96d6b49ffca3bf88a1ba76f7de24a1f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">A Pocket Philosophical Dictionary</a> consists of a series of short, witty, incisive essays arranged in alphabetical order on subjects ranging from atheism to tyranny. Concise by design — the ‘pocket’ medium was a response to the lengthy, verbose encyclopedias being produced at the time — this brilliant work includes Voltaire’s famed critiques of religion, dogma, superstition, fanaticism, and another rallying cry for toleration. Dripping in sarcasm throughout, and remaining startlingly fresh and modern with its conversational tone, the entries in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Philosophical-Dictionary-Oxford-Classics/dp/0199553637?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=a96d6b49ffca3bf88a1ba76f7de24a1f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">A Pocket Philosophical Dictionary</a> can be read in any order, making this a fun, thoughtful read for anyone interested in Voltaire and the ideas of the Enlightenment.</p>
