              <p><span className="big-letter">B</span>uddhism is a philosophical tradition based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, a prince who lived in ancient India around 500 BCE (exact dates vary). It’s thought the Buddha’s teachings were originally transmitted orally, and only written down in the 1st century BCE in Sri Lanka, with further Buddhist branches spreading throughout India, China, Tibet, Japan, and South-East Asia.</p>  

              <p>Encompassing as it does a variety of traditions, beliefs, and spiritual practices, Buddhism can be viewed as both a religion and a philosophy.</p>
              
              <p>However, unlike some other religions, its original philosophical teachings are not (necessarily) grounded in any appeals to ‘supernatural’ elements like a creator God or gods, resulting in the emergence of secular Buddhist movements that engender keen philosophical engagement.</p> 

              <p>The teachings of the Buddha — especially his focus on suffering (as discussed in our explainer on the <Link to="/articles/the-buddha-on-ending-suffering-the-parable-of-the-poisoned-arrow/">Buddha’s parable of the poisoned arrow</Link>), his <Link to="/articles/the-buddha-four-noble-truths-the-cure-for-suffering/">Four Noble Truths</Link>, and the concept of <Link to="/articles/anatman-buddhist-doctrine-of-no-self-why-you-do-not-really-exist/">anātman (no-self)</Link> — have fascinated thinkers for thousands of years, and offer a rich framework for facing up to life and suffering.</p>
              
              <p>While perhaps best known for its advocation of practices like mindfulness and meditation, and while many different schools and doctrines have grown up around its original teachings, the core of Buddhist philosophy has much to offer on a broad range of topics, from <Link to="/articles/metaphysics-what-is-it-why-is-it-important-today/">metaphysics</Link> to <Link to="/reading-lists/ethics-and-morality/">ethics</Link>.</p>

              <h2>1. What the Buddha Taught, by Walpola Rahula</h2>
              <BookLink title="What the Buddha Taught" author="Walpola Rahula" link="http://www.amazon.com/What-Buddha-Taught-Expanded-Dhammapada/dp/0802130313?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=b5d88632657f90adc759c4271a34d706&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.one.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />
              <p>Originally published in 1959, Sri Lankan Buddhist monk Walpola Rahula’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Buddha-Taught-Expanded-Dhammapada/dp/0802130313?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=b5d88632657f90adc759c4271a34d706&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">What the Buddha Taught</a> is a classic introduction to Buddhism still widely read and celebrated today.</p>
              
              <p>Clearly and concisely covering the Buddha’s core teachings, and drawing from original Buddhist texts, Rahula’s work is a fantastic place to start for anyone with a budding interest in the subject.</p>
              
              <p>Coming in at an accessible 151 pages, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Buddha-Taught-Expanded-Dhammapada/dp/0802130313?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=b5d88632657f90adc759c4271a34d706&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">What the Buddha Taught</a> is a very nice entry point to Buddhist philosophy.</p>
              

              <h2>2. The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching, by Thich Nhat Hanh</h2>
              <BookLink title="The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching" author="Thich Nhat Hanh" link="http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Buddhas-Teaching-Transforming-Liberation/dp/0767903692?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=cb1338b01cf20e5fc6618c946629ad14&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.two.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />
              <p>For a more recent and slightly more in-depth introduction to the development and core tenets of Buddhist philosophy, look no further than Thich Nhat Hanh’s 1999 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Buddhas-Teaching-Transforming-Liberation/dp/0767903692?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=cb1338b01cf20e5fc6618c946629ad14&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching</a>.</p>
              
              <p>Thich Nhat Hanh was a Buddhist Zen master heralded around the world as a fantastic Buddhist advocate and communicator. His brilliant introduction covers the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and much more. At 304 pages, this slightly longer introduction to Buddhism comes highly recommended.</p>
              

              <h2>3. Why Buddhism is True, by Robert Wright</h2>
              <BookLink title="Why Buddhism is True" author="Robert Wright" link="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment/dp/1439195463?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=d70187f94bf95dfa5361294cfe2500b3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" img={data.three.childImageSharp.gatsbyImageData} />
              <p>For an even more recent introduction to Buddhist philosophy — an introduction that is written very much from a Western secularist perspective — consider American author Robert Wright’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment/dp/1439195463?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=d70187f94bf95dfa5361294cfe2500b3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Why Buddhism is True</a>, published in 2017.</p>
              
              <p>Weaving in his own personal story and anecdotes, Wright attempts to show how key Buddhist teachings and practices are compatible with — and even backed by — the latest learnings from cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. If you’re seeking a highly readable, engaging introduction to Buddhism from a Western secularist perspective, Wright’s book is for you.</p>
