_Jonny Thomson teaches philosophy in Oxford in the UK, and runs the popular Instagram page, [Mini Philosophy](https://www.instagram.com/philosophyminis/), in which he introduces followers to a whole range of philosophical ideas through fun, bite-size, thought-provoking posts._ 

_We caught up with Jonny about why he thinks philosophy matters today, and picked his brain about his top three book recommendations for those looking to get into the subject._

## What's the definition of philosophy, from your perspective? 

<span class="big-letter">R</span>ecently, I‚Äôve come to see being philosophical much the same as being curious. In fact, I think ‚Äúcuriosity‚Äù is a much better modern term for philosophy than the classic ‚Äúlove of wisdom‚Äù line we get from its etymology. It‚Äôs only in the last few centuries that we‚Äôve come to see philosophy as being some discipline of its own. Science was once ‚Äúnatural philosophy‚Äù, and all the greatest early philosophers were as well known for their biology, psychology, history, politics, and so on... as they were for their philosophy. So, to be curious seems a good way to explain the philosophical mind.

Mary Midgley had a great story about this. She says that, growing up, there was one particular man who everyone referred to as being ‚Äúphilosophical‚Äù. She wondered what the word meant, and learned by an odd example. This philosophical man is at work one day, when an elm tree is caught by the wind, buffeted this way and that. It‚Äôs clearly going to topple. What makes the man ‚Äúphilosophical‚Äù, is that he just can‚Äôt go back to work. He can‚Äôt do anything else. He simply _has_ to find out which way the tree will fall down. And so he sits, entranced, waiting to find out what will happen.

That curiosity. That sense of wanting to know, just for the sake of it. That‚Äôs what I think philosophy is. Yes, it‚Äôs pretty broad, but that‚Äôs philosophy for you.

## What first sparked your interest in philosophy?

<span class="big-letter">M</span>y parents and a good teacher. Both my parents are psychologists, and they‚Äôre both hugely wise people. My dad taught me how to truly, properly, joyfully love reading, whilst my mum taught me that asking questions is about as fun as life can get.

But it was an inspirational teacher at school who taught me in exactly the right way, at exactly the right time, who showed how great philosophy can be. I suspect, in hindsight, my first forays into reading ‚Äúproper‚Äù philosophy (the primary source kind) were only to impress that teacher. But, once you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôre in. 

I think teachers have incredible power. For good and for bad.

## Why do you think learning about philosophy is important today?

<span class="big-letter">F</span>or some people, I think there are life-changing, transformative truths to be found in philosophy. There are certain issues and problems that come with just being a human, and when you find someone from an entirely different century or continent trying to solve those problems, I think it‚Äôs both reassuring and therapeutic. It‚Äôs nice to know some 14th-century monk was terrified of death, too.

>There‚Äôs a great pleasure and power in finding a thought or idea expressed so perfectly it could be ripped from your own soul.

Personally, I never find myself staying long enough with one particular philosopher to find _the_ answer, but I know some people have, and many people will. There‚Äôs a great pleasure and power in finding a thought or idea expressed so perfectly it could be ripped from your own soul. And yet, I‚Äôm much more of a philosophical magpie. I‚Äôll agree with Montaigne about this and Nietzsche about that. It‚Äôs Descartes in the morning, and Lao Tzu at night. I‚Äôll recommend Aristotle to some friends, and then Kierkegaard to others. But the truth is that they‚Äôre all important. 

So, having not answered the question at all, I can give the most frustratingly slippery answer there is ‚Äî you‚Äôve got to try doing philosophy to see what it can give you. It‚Äôs a process, an adventure, a therapy, an exploration, and a journey. You‚Äôll find some great things along the way, and some utter bilge, but the gold that you find will make you want to dive straight back in.

I think that‚Äôs quite enough mixed metaphors. 

## What would be your response to someone who dismisses philosophy as boring, outdated, or unimportant? 

<span class="big-letter">T</span>o be honest, I‚Äôd have to say, ‚Äúfair enough‚Äù. Sometimes, philosophy can be boring, outdated, or unimportant. I‚Äôve read stuff which is all three.

But ‚Äî there‚Äôs a _big_ caveat to that. 

Each of those words is massively context sensitive. What is boring to you now might not be in ten years‚Äô time. What seems outdated, has depths of truth when you come back to it later. And most of all, what seems inconsequential to you in an earlier part of life, will suddenly seem magnificently important later on. 

I came to properly read Simone de Beauvoir _[see our reading list of [Beauvoir‚Äôs best books](/reading-lists/simone-de-beauvoir-best-books/)]_, for instance, only in the last few years. I read her once when I was in school, and couldn‚Äôt get on board with it. Now, she‚Äôs my favorite philosopher to read. I think it‚Äôs a combination of my knowing more about philosophy, but also seeing more of life, to appreciate what she‚Äôs talking about. I think the same is true for authors like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy _[see our reading lists of [Dostoevsky‚Äôs best books](/reading-lists/fyodor-dostoevsky-best-books/) and [Tolstoy‚Äôs best books](/reading-lists/leo-tolstoy-best-books/)]_. They‚Äôre different experiences as you get older. I‚Äôve come to appreciate the Greeks much more, too. They really did say it all first, and they did so better than a lot of imitators that came after.

So, my response is basically to say ‚Äúyep, sometimes philosophy, as anything, can feel like that. But come back to it in a month, year, ten years, whatever, and give it another go‚Äù. 
I generally have faith that most of what‚Äôs considered to be a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù or ‚Äúgenius‚Äù is so for a reason, but I don‚Äôt think everyone discovers that at the same time.

## What are the top 3 books you recommend for people beginning to get interested in philosophy? 

<span class="big-letter">I</span>‚Äôd try to recommend three types of book. Firstly, _one book to ease you in_ (for me, that was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300187793/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=philosophybre-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0300187793&linkId=6ee8041c5bd48d5fb1ffa8244cf48e8d">Nigel Warburton‚Äôs A Little History of Philosophy</a>, which I binged in a day or two). Next, _one book to get you excited_ (for me, this is Nietzsche. Read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679724656?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=5ecc29f1c46a78a5417cf851de9c9757&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Beyond Good and Evil</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141195371?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=5ec5912e78e9d6bbdff90712b3dca5ea&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Genealogy of Morals</a> first, I think). Finally, _one classic that defined the subject_ (this has to be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0872201368/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=philosophybre-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0872201368&linkId=ab526722b79e2898d068d1febf19b3b2">Plato‚Äôs Republic</a>. It‚Äôs dense, it‚Äôs hard, but, by heck, it‚Äôs pretty much cover to cover gold).

## And, of course, you have a new book coming soon‚Ä¶ tell us about that

<span class="big-letter">Y</span>es, the shameless plug bit! Well, the idea behind the [Mini Philosophy Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/philosophyminis/) has always been to try to introduce philosophical ideas in an unthreatening and accessible way. As I mentioned above, I believe the joy and importance of philosophy comes in unearthing those ideas or thinkers who speak directly to you. As if they‚Äôre in your head, exploring and explaining ideas you always had but never could express yourself. 

So, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1472282175/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=philosophyb09-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1472282175&linkId=dcd361921d21d59cc3a4a08fccf7eadc">Mini Philosophy the book</a> is a bit like an invitation to look at the huge breadth of these ideas and then to dive more into them if you choose. A philosophical tasting menu...

I make sure to give every philosopher and idea as fair a hearing as possible. I hate the idea of misrepresenting or making a straw man of anything. So, the book is, as much as can be reasonably expected, an exploration of thinkers‚Äô ideas as they actually were, and not as they‚Äôre often disingenuously criticized or misunderstood.

Finally, it‚Äôs just really fun. It‚Äôs packed with everyday examples, pretty awful jokes, and more than a few flippant side comments. It‚Äôs meant to be easily read. It‚Äôs meant to make you smile. It‚Äôs meant to have you say, ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs pretty cool‚Äù as much as ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so true!‚Äù. If it does what I want it to, it'll be a gentle and readable guide into some pretty full on philosophy.
