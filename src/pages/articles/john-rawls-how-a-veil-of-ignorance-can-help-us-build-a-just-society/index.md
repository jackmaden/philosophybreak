<span class="big-letter">W</span>hat does a just society look like? How can we best organize ourselves to ensure no one is treated unfairly? How should we distribute power, wealth, and freedom?

These are difficult, complicated questions â€” and our answers to them are invariably shaped by our own life experiences, beliefs, and values.

Indeed, when we discuss whatâ€™s best for society, we are often at some level discussing whatâ€™s best for ourselves and our loved ones â€” or, at the very least, we are guided by our own conceptions of what â€˜goodnessâ€™ means.

Is there a way, then, to see beyond our own biases, interests, and beliefs? What can we do to establish a _disinterested_ account of justice? 

## The veil of ignorance

<span class="big-letter">W</span>hen dividing up portions of cake, a shrewd way to encourage fairness is to ensure the person slicing is _not_ the person deciding who gets which piece.

In this same spirit, 20th-century political philosopher John Rawls thought the best way to define a just society is to introduce a so-called â€˜veil of ignoranceâ€™.

Rawls asks us to imagine the laws weâ€™d all agree upon if we had no idea who weâ€™d be or where weâ€™d end up in society: we could be born into any family, in any situation, raised by the ideals of any belief system. 

Starting from this â€˜original positionâ€™ of ignorance about our personal characteristics and social circumstances, Rawls thinks most people would see it as rational and reasonable to agree to a certain level of universal welfare, education, opportunity, and the protection of basic rights and liberties.

After all, you could end up being anyone â€” rich or poor, healthy or sick.

Youâ€™re thus unlikely to propose a model where some people receive huge inheritances, and others are born into abject poverty; where some are subject to discrimination due to their race, creed, sexuality, or gender; where those with certain health conditions donâ€™t get the support they need.

In fact, Rawls thinks people operating under the veil of ignorance â€” if we assume they are motivated by rational self-interest â€” would eventually agree and build on two general principles of justice:

1. **Assigning Equality:** everyone is guaranteed basic liberties including freedom of thought, speech, expression, association, a right to hold property, and so on.
2. **Handling Inequality:** if everyone receives fair access to education, the opportunity to fully develop their capacities, and the chance to genuinely compete for positions of office, responsibility, trade, etc., then inequalities in wealth and power are permissible so long as they benefit the least advantaged members of society. For example, if someone shows particular talent for leadership, then they can enjoy the social and economic rewards that come with it, as long as this arrangement is structured in such a way that it is of maximal benefit to those lower in the hierarchy (i.e. it does not become harmful or exploitative, but improves the conditions of all, making everyone better off than they would be in any alternative system).

Of course, Rawls is not suggesting we literally implement a veil of ignorance and start society from scratch.

Rather, he proposes the veil of ignorance as a hypothetical thought experiment â€” something to bear in mind when seeking to establish the fundamental, disinterested principles of justice by which society should be governed.

In his 1971 work <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Justice-John-Rawls/dp/0674000781?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=32f800053d60a9b8127a0026165f8645&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">A Theory of Justice</a>, Rawls uses it as the starting point, the original position, from which he builds his case that societal justice essentially means _fairness_.

As he comments: 

>A just society is a society that if you knew everything about it, youâ€™d be willing to enter it in a random place.

## What do you make of this analysis?

- Do you agree with Rawlsâ€™ conception of justice here?
- Is the â€˜veil of ignoranceâ€™ a useful thought experiment, or is it useless to pontificate about a situation so removed from our own?
- What kind of system would _you_ propose if you had no idea where youâ€™d end up in society?
