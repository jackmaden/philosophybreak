<span class="big-letter">T</span>hink of someone you know very well. It could be a partner, family member, or close friend. You can imagine their behavior in most situations â€” you know whether theyâ€™re good in a crisis, what appeals to their sense of humor, what scares them, and more.

As much as you might know this person, however, thereâ€™s a gap in your knowledge that can never be filled.

Namely: you can never directly step into their lived experience. You can never actually feel their feelings, recall their memories, or experience their world.

Aldous Huxley brilliantly articulates this unknowable aspect to other people in his 1954 book <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Doors-Perception-Heaven-Hell/dp/0061729078?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=23cc5baf19a02f836d70277baf776c32&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Doors of Perception</a>. He begins by emphasizing just how impenetrably intricate individuals can be:

>Human beings are immensely complicated creatures, living simultaneously in a half dozen different worlds. Each individual is unique and, in a number of respects, unlike all the other members of the species. None of our motives is unmixed, none of our actions can be traced back to a single source and, in any group we care to study, behavior patterns that are observably similar may be the result of many constellations of dissimilar causes.

Our labels and categories are gross, shallow simplifications; our ideas about each other are ridiculous caricatures. As the writer Elizabeth Bibesco puts it:

>To others we are not ourselves but a performer in their lives, cast for a part we do not even know we are playing.

For, Huxley continues, though we all live alongside one another, our interior lives are ours alone:

>We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies â€” all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.

There is of course enough common ground between our â€˜island universesâ€™ that we are able to _imagine_ someone elseâ€™s perspective; but the depths and textures of our individual realities remain largely â€” in some cases totally â€” incommunicable. Huxley writes:

>Most island universes are sufficiently like one another to permit of inferential understanding or even of mutual empathy or â€˜feeling intoâ€™. Thus, remembering our own bereavements and humiliations, we can condole with others in analogous circumstances, can put ourselves (always, of course, in a slightly Pickwickian sense) in their places. But in certain cases communication between universes is incomplete or even nonexistent.

Perhaps part of this incommunicability comes from the fact that, much of the time, our â€˜island universesâ€™ are not only inaccessible to other people, they are inaccessible to _us_.

The philosopher-novelist Iris Murdoch hits on this in her great 1978 novel <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sea-Penguin-Twentieth-Century-Classics-ebook/dp/B004ELAANS?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=35c6a412c1590d793dac3be6d0932710&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">The Sea, The Sea</a> (see â€‹[Murdochâ€™s marvelous concept of â€˜unselfingâ€™ hereâ€‹](/articles/iris-murdoch-unselfing-is-crucial-for-living-a-good-life/)), in which one character observes:

>We are such inward secret creatures, that inwardness is the most amazing thing about us, even more amazing than our reason. But we cannot just walk into the cavern and look around. Most of what we think we know about our minds is pseudo-knowledge.

Unknown to ourselves, we are hungry to hear how others see us â€” and it can be a relief to believe them.

But if we struggle to properly understand or articulate our own feelings and experiences, how could other people possibly have anything other than a surface-level insight?

For, while we might infer someoneâ€™s state of mind from what they say or do, significant aspects of their interior lives remain completely unknowable to an outside observer. As Miltonâ€™s famous line in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradise-Lost-Penguin-Classics-Milton-ebook/dp/B002XHNNGQ?&linkCode=ll1&tag=philosophybre-20&linkId=345eeff0d676da4e6796e65f66e7bef0&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Paradise Lost</a> has it:

>The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heavenâ€¦

Alluding to this line, Huxley observes,

>The mind is its own placeâ€¦ Words are uttered, but fail to enlighten. The things and events to which the symbols refer belong to mutually exclusive realms of experience.

Perhaps a component of empathy and living compassionately with others, then, is not just trying to place ourselves in one anotherâ€™s shoes, but actively acknowledging that _we never fully canâ€¦_

Indeed, that we cannot escape our aloneness need not make us lonely, frustrated, or frightened; dwelling on it merely reveals that, given we cannot possess one anotherâ€™s lived experience, true connection _does not involve possession._

Rather, it involves recognition, acceptance, _protection._

As the great poet Rainer Maria Rilke put it: 

>Love consists in this: that two solitudes protect and border and greet each other.

## What do you make of the â€˜problemâ€™ of other minds?

<span class="big-letter">T</span>he unknowability of other minds causes a number of interesting philosophical conundrums not just in [ethics](/reading-lists/ethics-and-morality/), but in [metaphysics](/articles/metaphysics-what-is-it-why-is-it-important-today/) and [epistemology](/reading-lists/epistemology/) too.

Philosophers call it the _problem_ of other minds: if other peopleâ€™s â€˜island universesâ€™ are forever inaccessible, how can we even know they have minds and feelings at all? (The philosophical position of [solipsism](/articles/solipsism-definition-your-mind-is-the-only-thing-that-exists/), for instance, claims we cannot).

While positions like solipsism are rather extreme, reflecting on the inaccessibility of other minds does throw up some interesting questions, including:

- How much of what we think we know about others is a mere figment of our imaginations?
- Might we liberate ourselves from certain worries or concerns by doing better to recognize that, while our own minds are busily imagining and constructing certain realities, other peopleâ€™s minds are busy with completely _different_ realities?
- How do you build bridges into the lives of others?
- Do you agree that connection involves recognition and acceptance rather than possession and (total) comprehension?
- What do you think are the most effective ways to express and communicate shared features of the human experience?
- Why are we more compassionate about things we understand? Given the unknowability of other peopleâ€™s realities, could things we _donâ€™t_ understand perhaps be just as worthy of our compassion?
