<p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Information automatically collected</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</em></p>

This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
<p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in our Cookie Notice: <Link to="/cookie-policy/">philosophybreak.com/cookie-policy/</Link>.</p>

How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="legalbases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></em></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</p>
</li>
<li><p>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support our marketing activities</p>
</li>
<li><p>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</p>
</li>
<li><p>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>
<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdraw your consent</a> at any time.</p>
<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</p>
</li>
<li><p>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</p>
</li>
<li><p>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</p>
</li>
<li><p>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</p>
</li>
<li><p>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</p>
</li>
<li><p>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.

<h3>Mediavine Programmatic Advertising (Ver 1.1)</h3>
<p>The Website works with Mediavine to manage third-party interest-based advertising appearing on the Website. Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.</p>
<p>First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies (collectively, “Tags”) may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser’s cache. The "help" feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how to clear your browser’s cache. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">All About Cookies</a> and in our Cookie Notice: <Link to="/cookie-policy/">philosophybreak.com/cookie-policy/</Link>.</p>
<p>Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website content and features. Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site. In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on the Website.</p>
<p>The Website collects the following data using a cookie when serving personalized ads:</p>
<ul><li>IP Address</li><li>Operating System type</li><li>Operating System version</li><li>Device Type</li><li>Language of the website</li><li>Web browser type</li><li>Email (in hashed form)</li></ul>
<p>Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this data to link to other end user information the partner has independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements. Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor’s referral source to a particular website. Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.</p>

<h2 id="inforetain">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<h2 id="infosafe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
<h2 id="infominors">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>
<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at hello@philosophybreak.com.</p>
<h2 id="privacyrights">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>
<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>&quot; below.</p>
<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">Member State data protection authority</a> or <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/">UK data protection authority</a>.</p>
<p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>&quot; below.</p>
<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
<p><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section &quot;<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>&quot; below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. You may also <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">opt out of interest-based advertising by advertisers</a> on our Services.

<h2 id="DNT">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<h2 id="caresidents">11. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the &quot;Shine The Light&quot; law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
