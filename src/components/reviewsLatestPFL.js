            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Excellent course experience. I enjoyed all the chapters, but existentialism was my favorite - the best introduction to the topic I have read. The course covers things in good depth, and was easy to navigate on my laptop. The writing is excellent too - not always the case online (or in philosophy, for that matter).</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>First class course experience, from content to delivery, and excellent value for money. Chapters all clear, accessible and very useful. I'm teaching an introductory philosophy group on this subject, and this course has given me a brilliant resource to dip into. </span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Very good. I really appreciate how this course allowed me to have a glimpse into certain topics which are otherwise quite intimidating for me to get into. My overall experience of the course is very positive, and I highly encourage anyone with interest in philosophy to take it up.</span>
