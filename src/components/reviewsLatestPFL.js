            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>The course was very interesting and enriching. I loved the easy understanding of complex theories. My favorite chapters were on Aristotle and the Existentialists. Because they come closest to my personal moral beliefs. And the other chapters gave me new knowledge. Thank you. Keep going. Can't wait for the next course. </span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Iâ€™m really enjoying my How to lead a Good Life course - frankly, been trying to read philosophy for a decade and gave up - but what I read here is concisely and beautifully described for a lay person like me to appreciate. Thank you!</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Very good and stimulating, I will have to do again as so much to think through. Easy to follow, arguments and ideas explained well, this bear of little brain was able to work through things without having too much of a panic. I thought the chapter on Confucius interesting, especially as it was new to me. Thank you.</span>
