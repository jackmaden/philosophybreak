            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Easy to understand, entertaining and thought-provoking and has given me some new approaches that Iâ€™ll continue to think about. The first and last chapters were my favorites. I find the question 'why is there anything at all?' is a mind blower. And the last chapter (especially about absurdity) relates to that. Thanks!</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Wonderful, clear, concise, and very informative. This is a great introductory course, exactly what I was looking for in general and enough depth to inspire further investigations. I also really enjoy the reading lists at the end of the chapters and have taken up a few suggestions. Thanks!</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Brilliant primers on all the major topics of philosophy. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect but the content provides a ton of value, it's all brilliantly written and delivered and covers so much. Highly recommend if you're at all interested in philosophy.</span>
