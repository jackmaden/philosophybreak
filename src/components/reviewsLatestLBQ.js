            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Very good indeed. The course was well covered and varied, and I found all 5 chapters easy to follow, well presented and explaining various ideas and opinions. The chapter on free will was my favourite as in the past there were endless heated debates about this at our local Zen group! I’m very glad I discovered your website by chance on the internet.</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>A great overview and motivating for further study. Course delivery worked great - one-a-day was just right and I was left excited for the next day's delivery. I liked the way the context was set and particularly liked the fact that guidance was given - major topics, easy explanation of each. Overall a great intro to get started and I particularly appreciate the recommended reading lists for each, too.</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>The course is a very well-written, interesting overview of the main ideas in philosophy. It’s a concise, yet not superficial, exploration of the big questions, written in a way that challenges you to reframe your understanding on life. My favorite chapter was the Descartes and Matrix one (#2?). Thanks for this - it was great!</span>
