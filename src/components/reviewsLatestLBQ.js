            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Fantastic! Loved the delivery of one chapter per day and the content was fascinating. I didn’t know much about philosophy going into this, and some things like consciousness I didn’t realize had such a philosophical component. Really interesting, and I’d highly recommend the course.</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>I had a really good course experience, thanks. Good portion size of information each day, really easy to read, and really informative and interesting - cuts through a lot of waffle. Would recommend for anyone interested in philosophy.</span>
