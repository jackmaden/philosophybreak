            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Brilliant primers on all the major topics of philosophy. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect but the content provides a ton of value, it's all brilliantly written and delivered and covers so much. Highly recommend if you're at all interested in philosophy.</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Great! All content was very well written and easily digestible. Thoroughly enjoyed throughout. Free will was my favorite chapter, due to my personal interest in the subject, but all chapters were both interesting and easy to comprehend.</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Very good. After completing the course I am now planning to start a serious study of philosophy. My favorite chapter was Chapter 2: considering we perceive a 'photo' of reality, rather than reality itself, was a real breakthrough.</span>
