            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Wonderful, clear, concise, and very informative. This is a great introductory course, exactly what I was looking for in general and enough depth to inspire further investigations. I also really enjoy the reading lists at the end of the chapters and have taken up a few suggestions. Thanks!</span>

Highly recommend if you're at all interested in philosophy.</span>
