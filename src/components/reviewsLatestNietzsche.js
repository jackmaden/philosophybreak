            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>The content was excellent, stimulating, and well written. The course was interesting and challenging and exceeded my expectations. A lot of depth was shared on each topic. I read each chapter on the day it arrived. Ch. 5 was my favorite. The 3 topics are key to understanding Nietzsche. There is much to learn from this great thinker. Thank you for the opportunities.</span>

Loved the way the course was delivered and the writing was informative, interesting, and easy to understand. My favorite chapter was the final one on the will to power, I thought it brought everything together very nicely. Thanks for creating such an accessible course on Nietzsche!</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>It was really good. Honestly, there are things I thought I knew but turns out I had completely misunderstood from the books and the course helped me to figure out what I was missing. The content was very easy to understand and didactic, covering everything I was hoping for, and the difficulty of material was very well balanced. Please make more!</span>
