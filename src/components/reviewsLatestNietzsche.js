            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Amazing - so much help in understanding Nietzsche so I can attempt to finish my college paper. I struggled to understand him and his reasoning but with this it helped bring it full circle for me. Delivery of the course was perfect and easy to manage. Keep up the good work!</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Content was very interesting, easy to digest and still encouraging to reflect and find out more. It was also a way to refresh the basics I already had and an opportunity to reflect again about it.</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>An exceptionally good course. I have been studying philosophy independently for about 10 years... This is the best Nietzsche explanation I have seen. Keep creating work like this and I will always subscribe. Thank you for all the work you put into this.</span>
