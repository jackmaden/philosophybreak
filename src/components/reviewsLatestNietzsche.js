            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>The course was interesting and challenging and exceeded my expectations. The content was excellent, stimulating, and well written. A lot of depth was shared on each topic. I read each chapter on the day it arrived. Ch. 5 was my favorite. The 3 topics are key to understanding Nietzsche. There is much to learn from this great thinker. Thank you for the opportunities.</span>
