            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Great course experience, content was clear and simple to read. Loved the way the course was delivered and the writing was informative, interesting, and easy to understand. My favorite chapter was the final one on the will to power, I thought it brought everything together very nicely. Thanks for creating such an accessible course on Nietzsche!</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>It was really good. Honestly, there are things I thought I knew but turns out I had completely misunderstood from the books and the course helped me to figure out what I was missing. The content was very easy to understand and didactic, covering everything I was hoping for, and the difficulty of material was very well balanced. Please make more!</span>

            <span style={{lineHeight: "1.3"}}>Excellent. Well written and an enjoyable read on my iPhone. I found the content very interesting. It's been over 30 years since I took a course on Nietzsche - great to revisit the material at a later life stage and new perspective. My favorite chapter was the one on perspectivism.</span>
